### Hi there 👋

I'm Nit (he/him), currently a student and a Web & Server Dev/Designer ❤️‍🔥 (since '19) currently working at [Nitlix, eSwap, Fluid Client, Green Bot and more side projects.](https://nitlix.pro) 🥳

I have a passion for clean and terribly fast code, optimised and free for all analytics and making the internet a private and safe place.

My current side project is [eSwap (Yeah, it's private)](https://eswap.pro)

Mates... I have 3 times more private repo's than public repos, so don't you worry about how much I code.
